# RCPC: Remote Control for Personal Computer

# What is RCPC?
The RCPC (Remote Control Personal Computer)
solution utilizes socket connections to remotely control a personal
computer, allowing for real-time control and monitoring,
including access to files and programs. The solution includes a
server application for the personal computer and a client for the
mobile device, both of which use a socket to communicate securely.
The server listens for connections and creates a new thread for
each client, while the client connects to the server and
communicates through the socket's input and output streams.
This solution offers a convenient way to remotely control personal
computers for various applications such as remote work and
remote access to personal files.

The Client is an Android app that establishes a socket connection with a server at a given IP address and port. It does this by creating an instance of the Connection class, which extends the AsyncTask class to perform network operations in the background thread. The doInBackground method of this class creates a socket connection with the given IP address and port, and the onPostExecute method updates a boolean flag to indicate whether the connection was successful or not. This app is likely used to control the mouse, keyboard of the server Computer remotely.

The Server is a Java program that sets up a server socket and listens for incoming connections from a client. Once a client connects, the  program retrieves the client's IP address and updates the GUI waiting label to indicate that a connection has been established. The program also enables the disconnect button, which when clicked, closes the client and server sockets and updates the waiting label to indicate that the connection has been disconnected. The program uses a Robot instance to simulate mouse and keyboard actions, based on the commands  received from the client through the input stream. This program is likely used to receive commands from the Android app and control the mouse and keyboard of the server machine accordingly.
